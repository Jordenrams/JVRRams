                <p>Music is more than just a melody! There is a story behind every song. It should inspire people, but it also has a story. One song is about love, while another is about hate. The message of a song is often deep and not always explained by the artist to his listeners. </p></p> <span id="dots">....</span> <span id="more"> <p></p>
                                
                <p>In the story of the song, it becomes clear why the artist made the song. How he felt about it and what his thoughts were. There is a chance that the listener will not agree. The message and story of the song is therefore interpretation and can also be experienced differently. The message can come across differently than the artist intended.</p>
                
                <p>The story behind the songs makes the listener understand that there is more to a song than just a tune. It is made for a reason. <b>JVR Rams </b>wants to get this message across to its listeners.</p> </span>

              <h3>الصوما لمقديشو Somalia Mogadishu </h3>
              <p>Wiki of <b>Mogadishu</b>.
              </p> <span>

                <p>The goats lead me to a place far away from everyday life. I tried for a long time to follow the right path, but unfortunately I lost it... Until I suddenly met a goat, which led me to a land far away. A land that belongs to the Arabic culture. I ended up in front of a big mountain landscape. I hear voices telling me which way to go, but I don't listen to them. I go straight ahead! Through the mountains, it gets cold. The top was frozen, but still I kept following the goats. In the descent we went to the river Jubba. I took the boat there and travelled to the coast. The trade and the people. The somalis looked at me strangely, who is this stranger. I hid, but I was seen everywhere. Back to the goats! I followed, I ate, I slept, I drank and I walked. Until I heard the sound, the sound led me to another town. The goats started to run, and I ran with them! Yes, I am here! This is my destiny.</p> <p> 
                  Wiki of Somalia;

In 1960, Somalia regained its independence and became a member of the United Nations. Somalia is also a member of the African Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development.
</p> <p>ويكي الصوما لمقديشو الصومال مقديشو</p> <p>
  الماعز يؤدي بي إلى مكان بعيد عن الحياة اليومية. حاولت لفترة طويلة اتباع الطريق الصحيح ، ولكن للأسف فقدت ذلك... حتى التقيت فجأة عنزة ، مما قادني إلى أرض بعيدة. أرض تنتمي إلى الثقافة العربية. انتهى بي الأمر أمام المناظر الطبيعية الجبلية الكبيرة. أسمع أصواتا تقول لي أي طريق يجب أن أذهب ، لكنني لا أستمع إليهم. اذهب مباشرة إلى الأمام! من خلال الجبال ، يصبح الجو باردا. تم تجميد الجزء العلوي ، ولكن ما زلت أتابع الماعز. في النسب ذهبنا إلى نهر جوبا. أخذت القارب هناك وسافرت إلى الساحل. التجارة والناس. نظر الصوماليون إلي بغرابة ، من هو هذا الغريب. اختبأت ، ولكن شوهدت في كل مكان. العودة إلى الماعز! تابعت ، أكلت ، نمت ، شربت ومشيت. حتى سمعت الصوت ، قادني الصوت إلى بلدة أخرى. بدأت الماعز لتشغيل ، وركضت معهم! نعم, أنا هنا! هذا قدري
  </p> <p>
    ويكي الصومال;
    الصومال ، هي دولة في القرن الأفريقي ، على الحدود مع جيبوتي وإثيوبيا وكينيا. عاصمة الصومال هي مقديشو. الصومالية والعربية هي اللغات الرسمية للصومال. مع خط ساحلي يبلغ طوله 3000 كيلومتر ، فإن الصومال لديه أطول خط ساحلي لأي بلد في القارة الأفريقية وفي العالم العربي. ولأن الصومال مرتبط ثقافيا وتاريخيا وعرقيا ولغويا وجغرافيا ودينيا بالعالم العربي، فهو عضو في جامعة الدول العربية. في عام 1960 ، استعاد الصومال استقلاله وأصبح عضوا في الأمم المتحدة. الصومال هو أيضا عضو في الاتحاد الأفريقي ومنظمة التعاون الإسلامي والهيئة الحكومية الدولية المعنية بالتنمية.

              <h3>The Fall of Lothal</h3>
              <p>Wiki of <b>The Fall of Lothal</b>.
              </p> <span> Here I come! It took a long time, but I can see a beautiful city in the distance, with a harbour on the Sabarmati River. I walk on quickly and arrive in the busy city. I see a market full of traders exchanging precious stones and crystals. I am exhausted and go to the nearest inn. I steal my things and walk through the busy little town, looking at everything thoroughly. I see boats on the water, fishermen and traders. A large structure, the irrigation tank that provides clean water. At the inn, I eat quietly and go to sleep. 

              In the evening, I wake up to heavy rain and thunder. The city shakes, there is noise and chaos. The hostel moves enormously. WHAT IS HAPPENING! I run outside, but can't see anything because of the smoke and fog. Buildings are on fire, people are running. I hear a noise in the distance that is getting worse and worse. The water of the river is wild. The boats fly past my ears.  I am in shock. I try to run but I cannot. I am carried away by the current. It turns black before my eyes. Then I wake up, wounded in all my pain. There is havoc around me, no human to be seen. The city is a ruin. The city has fallen. 
              
              What am I to do now?</p>
              
              <p>Wikipedia of <b>Lothal</b>;
              <b>Lothal (Gujarat)</b> (Hill of the Dead) was one of the most important cities of the ancient Indus civilisation. It was located in the modern state of Gujarat and was founded around 2400 BC. It is the most important archaeological site in India of this civilisation. <b>Lothal</b> was discovered in 1954 and excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) began on 13 February 1955 and continued until 19 May 1960.
              
              Eventually, the constant threats of tropical storms and floods caused so much damage that the city was disrupted and eventually destroyed. The cause for the abandonment of the city may therefore have been a change of climate in addition to the natural disasters.
