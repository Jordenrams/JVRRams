              <h3>Kidnapped Daft Punk</h3>
              <p>Wiki of <b>Kidnapped Daft Punk</b>.
              </p>  
             <p>Based on an article, when Daft Punk got Kidnapped. But who is the murderer? Who of the people showing in this video could it be?</p>
              
             <p><b>The story of the Kidnapped Daft Punk:</b></p>
              
              <p>Wiki of Kidnapped Daft Punk: Source (Wundergroundmusic)
                French House duo Daft Punk have been found safe and unharmed in the basement of Nile Rodgers‘ Beverly Hills mansion.
                
                Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter (Daft Punk) are said to have been held against their will, by Rodgers, for over two years.
                
                Mr. Homem-Christo spoke today, for the first time, about his traumatic ordeal. “We had a meeting with Rodgers in May 2011, he wanted to discuss the possibility of releasing a disco album with us. We refused point blank, we really wanted to make something new and not go backwards, we’ve tried to do that with all our albums. Rodgers was furious when we turned him down, he stormed off and the next thing we knew we were being bundled into the back of a van.”
                
                Mr. Bangalter also opened up about the Kidnapping, “He didn’t hurt us but we were tied up and left in Darkness, it was horrible. We had no idea how long we were down there. The only contact we had with anyone was when we were given food and water.”
                
              </p> <p>The discovery was made after city workers accessed Mr. Rodgers’ house, while he was on tour, in search of the source of a gas leak.
                
                Chad Norris, a gas technician, spoke of his grim finding, “I went into the basement and the first thing that hit me was the smell. These poor guys had been living in their own piss and shit for two years, I’ve never seen anything like it. I called the cops straight away.”
                
                Upon searching the house, the LAPD also found a sophisticated crime lab, which contained the blueprints for two life sized Daft Punk Discobot Cyborgs. They now believe that Rodgers replaced the original Daft Punk with these disco loving cyborgs in order to record the album Random Access Memmories.
                
                Daft Punk are said to deeply upset after hearing the album, in particular the song Get Lucky, and plan on having it removed from existence as soon as possible.
                
                Rodgers and the Discobots are still at large and police say they should be treated with extreme caution.</p>

When spoken of in association with the neighbouring Halaib Triangle, it is sometimes referred to as the Bir Tawil Triangle, despite the area's quadrilateral shape; the two "triangles" border at a quadripoint. Its terra nullius status results from a discrepancy between the straight political boundary between Egypt and Sudan established in 1899, and the irregular administrative boundary established in 1902. Egypt asserts the political boundary, and Sudan asserts the administrative boundary, with the result that the Hala'ib Triangle is claimed by both and Bir Tawil by neither. In 2014, author Alastair Bonnett described Bir Tawil as the only place on Earth that was habitable but was not claimed by any recognised government.</p>

              <p>
                Outer space, commonly shortened to space, is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and its atmosphere and between celestial bodies. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a near-perfect vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7255 kelvins (−270.4245 °C; −454.7641 °F) +/-0.002 K. The plasma between galaxies is thought to account for about half of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe, having a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins. Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in the observable universe is dark energy, a type of vacuum energy that is poorly understood. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.</p>

              </p>  
             <p>Normally sandstorms don’t take long, but they can be killing. Especially people living in the Middle-East regions know what a sand/dust storm can do. Located Middle-Eastern cities are well prepared for those storms, but what about Europe and America?</p>
              
              
              <p>
                What is it like to be in a Sandstorm? The Middle Eastern music producer ALFAQA knows exactly what that means, remixing a song that differs far from the original but delivers a true story. He describes the event as follows: “Experiencing the sandstorm myself in Dubai, with the air turning brown/grey and dark. People ran inside and the streets were almost empty. A serious situation in which you MUST cover your face in order to breathe normally without inhaling sand! This memory gave me the inspiration to make a track about it, but I already found the perfect vibes in the ‘Sandstorm’ single made by Dutchmen JVR Rams. So I contacted him and showed him what I could make out of his 2019 single.”</p>

             <p>A historical event that will mark the history of space travel to the planet Mars. The first time an Arab set foot on a rocket that goes to space & Mars. The success story of the <b>Emirates Mars Mission!</b> This instrumental song made & produced by JVR Rams, describes the whole journey and excitement of the journey towards the Emirates Mars Mission, including the take-off/launch of the rocket. Let's not forget this amazing achievement made possible by the government of the United Arab Emirates. A huge step for humanity. Therefore a song to celebrate this achievement is known as the Emirates Mars Mission. Space vibes are incoming, prepare to launch!</p>
              
              
              <p><b>Wikipedia of the Emirates Mars Mission;</b></p>
              
              <p>
                The Emirates Mars Mission (مشروع الإمارات لاستكشاف المريخ)  is a United Arab Emirates Space Agency uncrewed space exploration mission to Mars. The Hope orbiter (مسبار الأمل) was launched on 19 July 2020, and went into orbit around Mars on 9 February 2021.
                
                The mission design, development, and operations are led by the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC). The spacecraft was assembled in the United States at the University of Colorado Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP), with support from Arizona State University (ASU) and the University of California, Berkeley.
                
                The space probe will study daily and seasonal weather cycles, weather events in the lower atmosphere such as dust storms, and how the weather varies in different regions of the planet. It will also add to knowledge about Mars atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen loss and other possible reasons behind the planet's drastic climate changes. The mission is being carried out by a team of Emirati engineers in collaboration with foreign research institutions, and is a contribution towards a knowledge-based economy in the UAE.
                
                Hope was the first of three space missions sent toward Mars during the July 2020 Mars launch window, with missions also launched by the national space agencies of China (Tianwen-1 orbiter, deployable and remote cameras, lander and Zhurong rover) and the United States (Mars 2020 and its Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter drone). The spacecraft was launched from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan with a Japanese rocket, the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries H-IIA launch vehicle. All three arrived at Mars in February 2021. The Emirates Mars Mission was the first of the three to arrive at Mars, performing a successful orbit entry maneuver on 9 February 2021
                
                On 9 February 2021, the United Arab Emirates became the first Arab country and the fifth country to reach Mars and the second country to successfully enter Mars' orbit on its first try.</p>

              </p>  
             <p>There are more secrets to reveal in <b>Area 51</b>, that's why the mystery never ends. To pump up the bass, ALFAQA made this amazing remix of my track 'Area 51'. 

              It is your moment! You are standing outside the gate. The gate to Area 51. The guards have not seen you. You approach the building, this is where the aliens must be. You sneak in. It is very dark, you can't see anything. Suddenly you hear a sort of humming sound. Suddenly an alarm goes off. You hear music coming from the speakers of the building. You see flashes of aliens. Not only that, but you become very frightened. You try to escape, the aliens run after you. There is no way out! You are stuck in Area 51! What is going to happen to you now! Help!</p>
              
              
              <p><b>Wikipedia of Area 51;</b></p>
              
              <p>Area 51 is the common name of a highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. A remote detachment administered by Edwards Air Force Base, the facility is officially called Homey Airport (XTA/KXTA) or Groom Lake (after the salt flat situated next to its airfield). Details of the facility's operations are not made public, but the USAF says that it is an open training range, and it is commonly thought to support the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The USAF acquired the site in 1955, primarily for flight testing the Lockheed U-2 aircraft.

                The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it the frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component of unidentified flying object (UFO) folklore. The base has never been declared a secret base, but all research and occurrences in Area 51 are Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI). The CIA publicly acknowledged the existence of the base for the first time on June 25, 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed in 2005, and, at the same time, they declassified documents detailing the history and purpose of Area 51.
                
                Area 51 is located in the southern portion of Nevada, 83 miles (134 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas. The surrounding area is a popular tourist destination, including the small town of Rachel on the "Extraterrestrial Highway".</p>

You see lights flashing, you hear the sound of eternity! So this is what Mark Zuckerberg was talking about! It's amazing, you can do infinite things here! A never-ending world! xQcOW was wrong, the metaverse is the most beautiful thing there is!</p>
              
              <p><b>Wikipedia of the Metaverse;</b></p>
              
              <p>A metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection. In futurism and science fiction, the term is often described as a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual and augmented reality headsets.
              
              The term "metaverse" has its origins in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe." Various metaverses have been developed for popular use such as virtual world platforms like Second Life. Some metaverse iterations involve integration between virtual and physical spaces and virtual economies, often including a significant interest in advancing virtual reality technology.
              
              The term has seen considerable use as a buzzword for public relations purposes to exaggerate development progress for various related technologies and projects. Information privacy and user addiction are concerns within metaverses, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole.</p>

               <p>
            A beautiful morning in Tauris. This week, it is time to travel with the group of merchants along the silk road. It is a trade mission to trade with other merchants from all over the world. You pack your things and prepare to go. The time has come, you have everything, and you are leaving. After a few days, you meet a caravan of traders, and you travel together. During the evening meal at the campfire, one of the traders tells a rumour about the land of pearls, which is on the Persian Gulf. The caravan says to go to Art, where it is easy to take a boat to the land of pearls. Normally it is too dangerous to go off the Silk Road, because the chance of surviving on your own is very small.  Now you have the chance to travel safely with a caravan. The decision is difficult! You have decided, you are going off the Silk Road! You say goodbye to the traders and decide to join the caravan. The first stop is the Iranian town of Minab, better known as Port Minab!</p>
                <p>
                  After a few days, you reach the town of 'Harmosia' better known as Minab. You are exhausted like all the other traders of the caravan. It is busy in the city as there is a bazaar called the Panjshambe bazaar. Here they sell prawns, fish, date palms and mangoes. It is a beautiful city! The caravan says to take a boat to the island of Qeshm in two days, as a stopover to the land of pearls. We put our things at the city inn. The city inn had a nice view of Minab's harbour. In Minab, there is a large castle, which is heavily guarded; what a building that is! I am going to rest because in two days we are going to travel to the island of Qeshm. In the evening, I dream of the land of pearls. What an adventure!</p>
                  <p>
                    The time has come to go to the island of Qeshm. After a few hours sailing, we dock at the port of Qeshm. It is a beautiful day, the water was calm. What a beautiful natural island! In the water there are some sailing boats called dhow, in the city there are many people trading goods. On the water there are many fishermen. The island looks like a paradise, with different names like Qeshm, Keshm, Kish, Tunb, Alexandria, Aracia and Abarkawan. I smell the sweet scent of dates and melons, and of the magroves. Hara marine forests look beautiful, this island is never to be forgotten. I enjoy the turtles on the beach, the salt caves and the beautiful colourful birds. Unfortunately, we won't stay here for long, we leave by boat tomorrow. The sailors say that it will be a long and difficult trip. I put my things in the Qeshm city hostel and go to sleep quietly, in the background I can hear the singing birds. I am getting closer and closer to the land of pearls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      There I am, packed and safe in the boat. There are many people on the boat, people who look different from us. They look like they are from another world. We are in the middle of the sea and there is not much to see. The water swings back and forth, there are some waves. The sea is not calm. Water is dripping everywhere, all I can hear is water. I go to sleep. Night is falling and the sea is getting wild! I am startled by the pounding of the waves that hit the boat. People are shouting, women are screaming! The boat is going to die! Am I going to die? This sea will swallow me up! Help....HELP!!! </p>
                      <p>
                        I am going to find out which island I am on! After talking to a local who luckily speaks my language, I find out that this island is called Gap-sabzu. Or Abu Musa. The island is located in the Persian Gulf. I am the only survivor of the shipwreck. There is a mountain on the island called Mount Halva, which is the highest point. I went there to think about what to do next. The island has a man-made line with some rocks, the rest of the island consists mainly of sand. There is a big lighthouse that keeps watch over the sea. .  I stay in a small inn, which is in a village in the middle of the island.

                <p>The goats lead me to a place far away from everyday life. I tried for a long time to follow the right path, but unfortunately I lost it... Until I suddenly met a goat, which led me to a land far away. A land that belongs to the Arabic culture. I ended up in front of a big mountain landscape. I hear voices telling me which way to go, but I don't listen to them. I go straight ahead! Through the mountains, it gets cold. The top was frozen, but still I kept following the goats. In the descent we went to the river Jubba. I took the boat there and travelled to the coast. The trade and the people. The somalis looked at me strangely, who is this stranger. I hid, but I was seen everywhere. Back to the goats! I followed, I ate, I slept, I drank and I walked. Until I heard the sound, the sound led me to another town. The goats started to run, and I ran with them! Yes, I am here! This is my destiny.</p> <p>

With a coastline of 3000 kilometres, Somalia has the longest coastline of any country on the African continent and in the Arab world. Because Somalia is culturally, historically, ethnically, linguistically, geographically and religiously linked to the Arab world, it is a member of the Arab League. In 1960, Somalia regained its independence and became a member of the United Nations. Somalia is also a member of the African Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development.

              <h3>The Fall of Lothal</h3>
              <p>Wiki of <b>The Fall of Lothal</b>.
              </p> <span> Here I come! It took a long time, but I can see a beautiful city in the distance, with a harbour on the Sabarmati River. I walk on quickly and arrive in the busy city. I see a market full of traders exchanging precious stones and crystals. I am exhausted and go to the nearest inn. I steal my things and walk through the busy little town, looking at everything thoroughly. I see boats on the water, fishermen and traders. A large structure, the irrigation tank that provides clean water. At the inn, I eat quietly and go to sleep. 

              In the evening, I wake up to heavy rain and thunder. The city shakes, there is noise and chaos. The hostel moves enormously. WHAT IS HAPPENING! I run outside, but can't see anything because of the smoke and fog. Buildings are on fire, people are running. I hear a noise in the distance that is getting worse and worse. The water of the river is wild. The boats fly past my ears.  I am in shock. I try to run but I cannot. I am carried away by the current. It turns black before my eyes. Then I wake up, wounded in all my pain. There is havoc around me, no human to be seen. The city is a ruin. The city has fallen. 
              
              What am I to do now?</p>
              
              <p>Wikipedia of <b>Lothal</b>;
              <b>Lothal (Gujarat)</b> (Hill of the Dead) was one of the most important cities of the ancient Indus civilisation. It was located in the modern state of Gujarat and was founded around 2400 BC. It is the most important archaeological site in India of this civilisation. <b>Lothal</b> was discovered in 1954 and excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) began on 13 February 1955 and continued until 19 May 1960.
              
              Eventually, the constant threats of tropical storms and floods caused so much damage that the city was disrupted and eventually destroyed. The cause for the abandonment of the city may therefore have been a change of climate in addition to the natural disasters.
