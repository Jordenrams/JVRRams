                <p>Music is more than just a melody! There is a story behind every song. It should inspire people, but it also has a story. One song is about love, while another is about hate. The message of a song is often deep and not always explained by the artist to his listeners. </p></p> <span id="dots">....</span> <span id="more"> <p></p>
                                
                <p>In the story of the song, it becomes clear why the artist made the song. How he felt about it and what his thoughts were. There is a chance that the listener will not agree. The message and story of the song is therefore interpretation and can also be experienced differently. The message can come across differently than the artist intended.</p>
                
                <p>The story behind the songs makes the listener understand that there is more to a song than just a tune. It is made for a reason. <b>JVR Rams </b>wants to get this message across to its listeners.</p> </span>

              </p>  
             <p>It feels weird, what is this? What is <b>the Metaverse?</b> Did Facebook turn into Meta? The Meta-World is part of the Metaverse?
              
              Here you are, you've signed up and been invited to enter the Metaverse! You're excited, you know it's a fictional world! You put on your headset and your gear. You see lights flashing, you hear the sound of eternity! So this is what Mark Zuckerberg was talking about! It's amazing, you can do infinite things here! A never-ending world! xQcOW was wrong, the metaverse is the most beautiful thing there is!</p>
              
              <p><b>>Wikipedia of the Metaverse;</b></p>
              
              <p>A metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection. In futurism and science fiction, the term is often described as a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual and augmented reality headsets.
              
              The term "metaverse" has its origins in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe." Various metaverses have been developed for popular use such as virtual world platforms like Second Life. Some metaverse iterations involve integration between virtual and physical spaces and virtual economies, often including a significant interest in advancing virtual reality technology.
              
              The term has seen considerable use as a buzzword for public relations purposes to exaggerate development progress for various related technologies and projects. Information privacy and user addiction are concerns within metaverses, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole.</p>

              <p>Wiki of <b>Intro Off the Silk Road (Album)</b>.
               <p> Off the Silk Road! How does it feel to abandon the path? You hear about the land of pearls and decide to see it for yourself. Will you arrive there, is the merchant company to be trusted? Does it really exist? So many questions, but what do you have to lose? You will have a look for yourself. An album about a fiery journey Off the Silk Road to the land of pearls! </p>

               <p>Album List:</p>
               <p><b>Intro Off the Silk Road</b></p>
               <p><b>Port Minab</b></p>

               <p><b>The Sinking Ship of the Persian Gulf</b></p>
               <p><b>Abu Musa</b></p>
               <p>
            A beautiful morning in Tauris. This week, it is time to travel with the group of merchants along the silk road. It is a trade mission to trade with other merchants from all over the world. You pack your things and prepare to go. The time has come, you have everything, and you are leaving. After a few days, you meet a caravan of traders, and you travel together. During the evening meal at the campfire, one of the traders tells a rumour about the land of pearls, which is on the Persian Gulf. The caravan says to go to Art, where it is easy to take a boat to the land of pearls. Normally it is too dangerous to go off the Silk Road, because the chance of surviving on your own is very small.  Now you have the chance to travel safely with a caravan. The decision is difficult! You have decided, you are going off the Silk Road! You say goodbye to the traders and decide to join the caravan. The first stop is the Iranian town of Minab, better known as Port Minab!</p>
                <p>
                  After a few days, you reach the town of 'Harmosia' better known as Minab. You are exhausted like all the other traders of the caravan. It is busy in the city as there is a bazaar called the Panjshambe bazaar. Here they sell prawns, fish, date palms and mangoes. It is a beautiful city! The caravan says to take a boat to the island of Qeshm in two days, as a stopover to the land of pearls. We put our things at the city inn. The city inn had a nice view of Minab's harbour. In Minab, there is a large castle, which is heavily guarded; what a building that is! I am going to rest because in two days we are going to travel to the island of Qeshm. In the evening, I dream of the land of pearls. What an adventure!</p>
                  <p>
                    The time has come to go to the island of Qeshm. After a few hours sailing, we dock at the port of Qeshm. It is a beautiful day, the water was calm. What a beautiful natural island! In the water there are some sailing boats called dhow, in the city there are many people trading goods. On the water there are many fishermen. The island looks like a paradise, with different names like Qeshm, Keshm, Kish, Tunb, Alexandria, Aracia and Abarkawan. I smell the sweet scent of dates and melons, and of the magroves. Hara marine forests look beautiful, this island is never to be forgotten. I enjoy the turtles on the beach, the salt caves and the beautiful colourful birds. Unfortunately, we won't stay here for long, we leave by boat tomorrow. The sailors say that it will be a long and difficult trip. I put my things in the Qeshm city hostel and go to sleep quietly, in the background I can hear the singing birds. I am getting closer and closer to the land of pearls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      There I am, packed and safe in the boat. There are many people on the boat, people who look different from us. They look like they are from another world. We are in the middle of the sea and there is not much to see. The water swings back and forth, there are some waves. The sea is not calm. Water is dripping everywhere, all I can hear is water. I go to sleep. Night is falling and the sea is getting wild! I am startled by the pounding of the waves that hit the boat. People are shouting, women are screaming! The boat is going to die! Am I going to die? This sea will swallow me up! Help....HELP!!! </p>
                      <p>
                        I am going to find out which island I am on! After talking to a local who luckily speaks my language, I find out that this island is called Gap-sabzu. Or Abu Musa. The island is located in the Persian Gulf. I am the only survivor of the shipwreck. There is a mountain on the island called Mount Halva, which is the highest point. I went there to think about what to do next. The island has a man-made line with some rocks, the rest of the island consists mainly of sand. There is a big lighthouse that keeps watch over the sea. .  I stay in a small inn, which is in a village in the middle of the island.

              <p>Wiki of <b>Mogadishu</b>.
              </p> <span>

                <p>The goats lead me to a place far away from everyday life. I tried for a long time to follow the right path, but unfortunately I lost it... Until I suddenly met a goat, which led me to a land far away. A land that belongs to the Arabic culture. I ended up in front of a big mountain landscape. I hear voices telling me which way to go, but I don't listen to them. I go straight ahead! Through the mountains, it gets cold. The top was frozen, but still I kept following the goats. In the descent we went to the river Jubba. I took the boat there and travelled to the coast. The trade and the people. The somalis looked at me strangely, who is this stranger. I hid, but I was seen everywhere. Back to the goats! I followed, I ate, I slept, I drank and I walked. Until I heard the sound, the sound led me to another town. The goats started to run, and I ran with them! Yes, I am here! This is my destiny.</p> <p> 
                  Wiki of Somalia;

</p> <p>ويكي الصوما لمقديشو الصومال مقديشو</p> <p>
  الماعز يؤدي بي إلى مكان بعيد عن الحياة اليومية. حاولت لفترة طويلة اتباع الطريق الصحيح ، ولكن للأسف فقدت ذلك... حتى التقيت فجأة عنزة ، مما قادني إلى أرض بعيدة. أرض تنتمي إلى الثقافة العربية. انتهى بي الأمر أمام المناظر الطبيعية الجبلية الكبيرة. أسمع أصواتا تقول لي أي طريق يجب أن أذهب ، لكنني لا أستمع إليهم. اذهب مباشرة إلى الأمام! من خلال الجبال ، يصبح الجو باردا. تم تجميد الجزء العلوي ، ولكن ما زلت أتابع الماعز. في النسب ذهبنا إلى نهر جوبا. أخذت القارب هناك وسافرت إلى الساحل. التجارة والناس. نظر الصوماليون إلي بغرابة ، من هو هذا الغريب. اختبأت ، ولكن شوهدت في كل مكان. العودة إلى الماعز! تابعت ، أكلت ، نمت ، شربت ومشيت. حتى سمعت الصوت ، قادني الصوت إلى بلدة أخرى. بدأت الماعز لتشغيل ، وركضت معهم! نعم, أنا هنا! هذا قدري

    ويكي الصومال;

              <h3>The Fall of Lothal</h3>
              <p>Wiki of <b>The Fall of Lothal</b>.
              </p> <span> Here I come! It took a long time, but I can see a beautiful city in the distance, with a harbour on the Sabarmati River. I walk on quickly and arrive in the busy city. I see a market full of traders exchanging precious stones and crystals. I am exhausted and go to the nearest inn. I steal my things and walk through the busy little town, looking at everything thoroughly. I see boats on the water, fishermen and traders. A large structure, the irrigation tank that provides clean water. At the inn, I eat quietly and go to sleep. 

              In the evening, I wake up to heavy rain and thunder. The city shakes, there is noise and chaos. The hostel moves enormously. WHAT IS HAPPENING! I run outside, but can't see anything because of the smoke and fog. Buildings are on fire, people are running. I hear a noise in the distance that is getting worse and worse. The water of the river is wild. The boats fly past my ears.  I am in shock. I try to run but I cannot. I am carried away by the current. It turns black before my eyes. Then I wake up, wounded in all my pain. There is havoc around me, no human to be seen. The city is a ruin. The city has fallen. 
              
              What am I to do now?</p>
              
              <p>Wikipedia of <b>Lothal</b>;
              <b>Lothal (Gujarat)</b> (Hill of the Dead) was one of the most important cities of the ancient Indus civilisation. It was located in the modern state of Gujarat and was founded around 2400 BC. It is the most important archaeological site in India of this civilisation. <b>Lothal</b> was discovered in 1954 and excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) began on 13 February 1955 and continued until 19 May 1960.
              
              Eventually, the constant threats of tropical storms and floods caused so much damage that the city was disrupted and eventually destroyed. The cause for the abandonment of the city may therefore have been a change of climate in addition to the natural disasters.
